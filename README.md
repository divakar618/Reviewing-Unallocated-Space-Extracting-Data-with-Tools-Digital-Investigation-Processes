# Reviewing-Unallocated-Space-Extracting-Data-with-Tools-Digital-Investigation-Processes
## AIM:
To review unallocated space in a disk image, extract data using forensic tools, and understand the digital investigation process.
## REQUIREMENTS
- Autopsy or FTK Imager
- Sleuth Kit (TSK)
- Hex Editor (e.g., HxD)
- Operating System: Windows 10/11 or Linux (Kali preferred)

    D --> E[Carve and Recover Files]
    E --> F[Analyze Recovered Data]
    F --> G[Document Findings in Report]
```
## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1 (Acquire Evidence Image):
- Obtain the disk image in ```.dd``` or ```.E01``` format from a trusted forensic acquisition process.
- Verify hash values (MD5/SHA256) to maintain integrity.

### Step 2(Load Image into Forensic Tool):
- Open Autopsy or FTK Imager.
- Create a new case and add the evidence image.

### Step 3(Locate Unallocated Space):
- Navigate to the partition structure view.
- Identify sectors not assigned to any partition (unallocated).
### Step 4(Analyze & Carve Data):
- Use built-in data carving tools to search for file signatures (JPEG, DOCX, PDF, etc.).
- Preview carved files for relevance.
